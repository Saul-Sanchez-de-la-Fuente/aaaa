## Series circuits
The following schematic diagram shows a series circuit:

The preceding diagram shows a series circuit where the current only has
one path from the source to the return. In this circuit, the load consists of
two resistors. One resistor has a value of 330 ohms and the other has a
value 220 ohms. Now let's look at several properties of a series circuit.


## Resistance

The total resistance of a series circuit is the sum of the resistance of each
component of the load. In the example circuit, the load consists of two
resistors with values of 220 ohms and 330 ohms. If we add these two values
together we get a total resistance of 550 ohms.



## Voltage
The total voltage of a series circuit is the sum of the voltage of each power
source connected in series. In the example circuit, there is only one power
source, which is a 9V battery, therefore, the total voltage is 9 volts. If we
used 4 AA batteries (1.5 volts each) in series, rather than the 9-volt battery,
we would have a total voltage of 6 volts because 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V +
1.5V would equal 6 volts.


## Current
In a series circuit, the same current flows through each part of the circuit.
This means that we can measure the current at any point within the circuit
and it will be the same as any other point in the circuit.
In the example circuit, we know the total voltage (9 volts) and we know the
total resistance (550 ohms) therefore we can calculate the current of the
circuit using Ohm's law, where I=V/R. This formula would give us a current
of 9 volts/550 ohms or 0.0164 amps (16.4 milliamps).
